    "Description": "A tool for planning retrosynthesis of a target molecule based on template reactions and a stock of precursors. The algorithm breaks down the input molecule into purchasable blocks until it has been completely solved.\n",

    "Output Shape": "Flexible List",
    "Interpretation": "The fraction of solved precursors and the number of reactions required for synthesis. Close to 1.0 for a solved compound, less than 0.8 for unsolved.",
