# Model description
A tool for planning retrosynthesis of a target molecule. Utilizes a [pretrained model, template reactions, and reagent stock](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/AiZynthFinder_a_fast_robust_and_flexible_open-source_software_for_retrosynthetic_planning/12334577) provided by AiZynthFinder.
- Input: SMILES
- Output: Retrosynthesis score. For now, our adaptation of AiZynthFinder will only output the retrosynthesis score provided by the AiZynthFinder model. From the developers: "the score reflects the fraction of solved precursors and the number of reactions required to synthesize the target compound. The score for a solved compound is close to 1.0, whereas the score for an unsolved compound is typically less than 0.8" (Genheden et. al).
- Model type: Generative (will produce a series of retrosynthesis steps when fully adapted to EOS)
- Mode of training: Pretrained
